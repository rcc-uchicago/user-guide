## Environment Configurations

=== "Midway3"

    **Available R Versions:**
    - `R/3.6.3`
    - `R/4.0.3`
    - `R/4.1.0`
    - `R/4.2.0`
    - `R/4.2.1`
    - `R/4.2.1-no-openblas` *(built with default BLAS; no OpenBLAS/MKL acceleration)*
    - `R/4.2.2`
    - `R/4.2.3`
    - `R/4.3.1`
    - `R/4.4.1` **(default)**
    - `R/4.4.1+oneapi-2024.2.0` *(Intel oneAPI build, see below)*
    - `R/4.4.2+gcc-13.2.0` *(built with GCC 13.2.0, see below)*

    ??? info "Build Details (click to expand)"
        - Most R modules are built with the system GCC compiler (`8.4.1`).
        - `R/4.2.1-no-openblas` is built with the default BLAS (no OpenBLAS or MKL), which may result in slower linear algebra performance.
        - `R/4.4.1+oneapi-2024.2.0` is built with Intel oneAPI 2024.2.0 and linked to Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL). This provides maximum performance for matrix and linear algebra operations, leveraging the latest Intel hardware/software optimizations. The module automatically loads `oneapi/2024.2` and sets all relevant paths and environment variables for you. Use this if you need high-performance math.
        - `R/4.4.2+gcc-13.2.0` is built with GCC 13.2.0. Use this version if your R library requires a newer GCC toolchain (for example, the `arrow` package or other modern C++-dependent libraries).

    **Geospatial Meta-Module:**
    - There is a meta-module for geospatial applications: `gis/R-4.2.1`. Loading this module will automatically load `R/4.2.1` along with all required geospatial libraries (`GDAL`, `GEOS`, `PROJ`, `SQLite`, `udunits`) for spatial data analysis. This is the recommended setup for users working with spatial or GIS data on Midway3.

    **AMD Node Module:**
    - On Midway3 AMD nodes, there is a special module `R/4.3.2 (default)` built with the AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (`aocc-4.1`). This module is found under `/software/modulefiles-amd` and is optimized for AMD hardware. Use this version for best performance on AMD compute nodes.

=== "Midway2"

    **Available R Versions:**
    - `R/2.15`
    - `R/3.0`
    - `R/3.2`
    - `R/3.3`
    - `R/3.3+intel-16.0` *(built with Intel 16 compiler)*
    - `R/3.4`
    - `R/3.4.1`
    - `R/3.4.3`
    - `R/3.5.1`
    - `R/3.6.1`
    - `R/3.6.3-no-openblas`
    - `R/4.0.0`
    - `R/4.0.4`
    - `R/4.1.0`
    - `R/4.1.0-no-openblas`
    - `R/4.2.0`

    ??? info "Build Details (click to expand)"
        - Most R modules are built with the system GCC compiler (`10.2.0` for recent versions; older modules may use earlier GCC or Intel compilers).
        - `R/3.3+intel-16.0` is built with the Intel 16 compiler.
        - `R/3.6.3-no-openblas` and `R/4.1.0-no-openblas` use the default BLAS (no OpenBLAS), which may reduce linear algebra performance.
        - Most modern modules (`R/4.1.0`, `R/4.2.0`) are built with `gcc/10.2.0`.
        - All modules are linked to OpenBLAS for improved matrix and linear algebra performance unless otherwise noted.
        - For exact dependencies and environment, use `ml show R/<version>`.

## Using the `renv` Package for Reproducibility

!!! tip "Quick Steps for renv Reproducibility"
    1. **Load the R module:**
        ```bash
        module load R/4.3.1
        ```
    2. **Navigate to your project directory and start R:**
        ```bash
        cd /project/pi-cnetid/rproject/
        R
        ```
    3. **Install and initialize renv:**
        ```R
        install.packages("renv")
        renv::init()
        ```
    4. **Install packages as needed:**
        ```R
        install.packages("dplyr")
        # ...etc.
        ```
    This will create a project-local library and `renv.lock` file for reproducibility.

## Using R for High-Performance Computing (HPC)

You can run R scripts in batch mode using SLURM. Example job script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_r_job
#SBATCH --account=[your-accountname]
#SBATCH --partition=compute
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --mem=16G
#SBATCH --time=02:00:00

module load R/4.3.1
Rscript my_script.R
```

??? note "Parallel R with MPI (Rmpi)"

    The `Rmpi` package is **not pre-installed** in system R modules. You must install it in your own R user library, and Rmpi must be compiled against the **same MPI implementation and version** you will use at runtime.

    **Example SLURM Batch Script for Rmpi Job:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name=my_rmpi_job
    #SBATCH --account=[your-accountname]
    #SBATCH --partition=compute
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks=4
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
    #SBATCH --mem=16G
    #SBATCH --time=02:00:00

    module load R/4.3.1 openmpi/5.0.2  # Example: use any available OpenMPI version
    mpirun -np 4 Rscript my_rmpi_script.R
    ```

    **Step-by-step instructions:**
    1. **Load R and OpenMPI modules _before_ installing Rmpi:**
        ```bash
        module load R/4.3.1 openmpi/5.0.2  # Example: use any available OpenMPI version
        R
        ```
    2. **Install Rmpi from within R:**
        ```R
        install.packages("Rmpi", type = "source")
        ```
        You may be prompted for MPI library paths; the correct `openmpi` module must be loaded for detection.
    3. **Check installation:**
        ```R
        library(Rmpi)
        mpi.universe.size()
        ```
    4. **Important:** Always load the same `openmpi` module before running your parallel R jobs as you did when installing Rmpi.

    !!! tip "Other OpenMPI Versions"
        To see all installed OpenMPI versions, run:
        ```bash
        module avail openmpi
        ```

    !!! tip "Version Compatibility"
        - The `openmpi` version must match between installation and job execution.
        - If you change R or MPI module versions, reinstall `Rmpi` to match.

## Best Practices

### R Module (Midway)
- Uses centrally maintained, optimized, and regularly updated R installations provided by HPC admins.
- Usually highly optimized (OpenBLAS).
- Integrates with system-wide libraries and supports `renv` for reproducibility.
- Recommended for most HPC users, especially for performance-critical or collaborative work.

### R via Conda
- Allows creation of isolated environments and user-space installation of R and dependencies.
- **Performance Caveat:** Conda R often does **not** use the highly optimized BLAS/LAPACK libraries available on the cluster, which can result in slower performance for linear algebra-intensive tasks.
- Use Conda R only if you need a specific version or package unavailable in system modules, or require full environment isolation.
- If using Conda R, you can still use `install.packages()` or `renv` within the environment, but be aware of possible compatibility and performance trade-offs.

| Feature/Aspect          | R Module (Midway)                       | Conda R                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| BLAS/LAPACK Optimization | Usually highly optimized (OpenBLAS)     | Often default/less optimized BLAS       |
| Performance            | Best for heavy computation               | May be slower for matrix operations     |
| Integration            | Well-integrated with system libraries    | Isolated, may miss system optimizations |
| Reproducibility        | Use with `renv` or modules               | Use with `renv` or Conda YAML           |
| Use Case               | Recommended for most HPC users           | For custom/isolated needs only          |


## Troubleshooting

- **Error:** Package installation fails due to missing system libraries
  - **Solution:** Load the necessary modules (e.g., `module load hdf5 netcdf`) before starting R.
- **Error:** R cannot find installed packages
  - **Solution:** Check your `.libPaths()` in R and ensure you are using the correct environment/module.
- **Error:** R job runs slowly
  - **Solution:** Use the system R module for optimized BLAS/LAPACK performance. Avoid Conda R for heavy computations unless necessary.
- **Error:** Permissions or disk quota exceeded
  - **Solution:** Check your disk space with `quota` and clean up files if needed.

### Installing R Packages: A Comprehensive Guide

R packages can be distributed as source code or compiled binaries. Source packages must be compiled before installation, typically requiring the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Here’s how to get started with R package installation on our HPC clusters.

#### Check GCC Version

To ensure compatibility, verify the version of GCC (g++) on your system:

```sh
$ g++ --version
g++ (GCC) 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-10)
Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

#### Before You Install

1. **Check Disk Space**:
   Ensure you have enough disk space using the `quota` command:
   ```sh
   $ quota
   ```

2. **Load Necessary Modules**:
   For packages like `ncdf4` and `hdf5r`, load the required modules before starting R:
   ```sh
   $ module load hdf5 netcdf
   ```
   For more information on working with netCDF files in R, you can check out this resource: [NetCDF with R](https://pjbartlein.github.io/REarthSysSci/netCDF.html). 


#### Installing Packages

To install R packages, use the `install.packages` function within an R session:

```R
install.packages("packageName")
```

For multiple packages:

```R
install.packages(c("package1", "package2"))
```

## FAQ

1. **Delete All R Packages and Start Over**:
   If you need to reset your R environment, delete all R packages and related files:
   ```sh
   $ rm -rf ~/R ~/.R ~/.rstudio* ~/.Rhistory ~/.Rprofile ~/.RData
   ```

2. **Update ~/.bashrc**:
   Remove any added or modified environment variables if necessary.

3. **See Where R Packages Are Installed**:
   ```R
   .libPaths()
   Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")
   ```

4. **List Installed Packages**:
   ```R
   installed.packages()
   ```

5. **List Default Packages**:
   ```R
   getOption("defaultPackages")
   ```

6. **Remove a Package**:
   ```R
   remove.packages("packageName")
   ```

## Using the `renv` R Package to Create a Personal R Project Environment on the Midway Cluster

The `renv` package in R helps manage project-specific libraries, ensuring consistent package versions across projects. Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up and use `renv` for your project located at `/project/pi-cnetid/rproject/` on the Midway cluster.

#### Step 1: Load Necessary Modules

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary modules loaded. You can load the R module appropriate for your project:

```sh
module load R/4.3.1
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Project Directory

Navigate to your project directory:

```sh
cd /project/pi-cnetid/rproject/
```

#### Step 3: Initialize `renv` in Your Project

Start R and initialize `renv` in your project directory:

```sh
R
```

Inside the R session, run:

```R
# Install renv if not already installed
install.packages("renv")

# Initialize renv in the project directory
renv::init()
```

This command will set up a new project-specific library in the `renv` subdirectory of your project directory and create an `renv.lock` file to record the state of your library.

#### Step 4: Install Packages within the `renv` Environment

With `renv` initialized, install any necessary packages:

```R
# Install required packages
renv::install("dplyr")
renv::install("ggplot2")
# Add more packages as needed
```

#### Step 5: Snapshot the Current State of Your Library

After installing the necessary packages, snapshot the current state of your library to `renv.lock`:

```R
renv::snapshot()
```

This records the exact versions of the packages you have installed, allowing you to recreate the environment later.

#### Step 6: Restore Library from `renv.lock` (Optional)

If you need to recreate the environment on another system or after a system change, you can restore the library:

```R
renv::restore()
```

This command reads the `renv.lock` file and installs the specified package versions.

#### Step 7: Using the Project

Whenever you start working on your project, load the `renv` environment:

```R
# Activate the renv environment
renv::activate()
```

This ensures that all package installations and library paths are managed by `renv`.

#### Example Workflow

Here’s a complete example workflow from the terminal to R session:

1. **Load R Module**:
   ```sh
   module load R/4.3.1
   cd /project/pi-cnetid/rproject/
   ```

2. **Start R and Initialize `renv`**:
   ```sh
   R
   ```

3. **Within R Session**:
   ```R
   install.packages("renv")
   renv::init()
   renv::install("dplyr")
   renv::install("ggplot2")
   renv::snapshot()
   q()  # Quit R session
   ```

4. **Future Sessions**:
   ```R
   renv::activate()
   ```

By following these steps, you can set up and manage a project-specific R environment on the Midway cluster, ensuring consistency and reproducibility for your R projects.
