# Connecting to Midway FAQ


### What login shells are supported and how do I change my default shell? "
RCC supports the following shells:
```
/bin/bash
/bin/tcsh
/bin/zsh
```
Use this command to change your default shell:
``` 
chsh -s /path/to/shell 
```

It may take up to 30 minutes for that change to take effect.

### Is remote access with Mosh supported? "
Yes. To use Mosh, first log in to Midway via SSH, and add the command module load mosh to your ```~/.bashrc``` (or ```~/.zshenv``` if you use zsh). Then, you can log in by entering the following command in a terminal window:

=== "Midway2"
``` 
mosh <CNetID>@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu 
```
=== "Midway3"
```
mosh <CNetID>@midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu
```  

### Why am I getting “ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer” when I try to log in via SSH? "
You can get this error if you incorrectly enter your password too many times. This is a security measure that is in place to limit the ability for malicious users to use brute force SSH attacks against our systems.

After 3 failed password entry attempts, an IP address will be blocked for 4 hours.

While you wait for the block to be lifted, you should still be able to access the RCC system using ThinLinc.

### Why am I getting prompted for YubiKey when I try to log in via SSH? "
There are few reasons to get that error message. Please enroll in two factor authentication if you have not done already by visiting https://cnet.uchicago.edu/2FA/. Please make sure you run:
=== "Midway2"
``` 
ssh -Y CNetID@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu 
```
=== "Midway3"
```
ssh -Y CNetID@midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu
```
Finally, please make sure your RCC account has not expired.
