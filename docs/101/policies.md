# RCC Terms of Use

Welcome to the Research Computing Center (RCC), where you gain access to a diverse range of clusters, computer systems, networks, applications, and technological assets. To ensure a positive and responsible experience, please familiarize yourself with the RCC Terms of Use outlined below. By using RCC resources, you agree to abide by these rules, ensuring ethical and lawful use.

## General Usage

Abiding by the following principles is mandatory for utilizing RCC resources responsibly:

* **Responsibility:** Users are accountable for proper tool utilization and maintaining confidentiality. In addition, they must maintain an environment in which all RCC users can fairly access RCC clusters to run jobs or store data. 
* **Legality and Ethics:** RCC resources must not be used for illegal, malicious, or unethical purposes.
* **Respect:** Users should refrain from unauthorized use, academic dishonesty, or violation of software licenses.
* **Confidentiality:** Respect the privacy of individuals and report any security breach promptly.
* **Security:** Users must not attempt to circumvent system security or resource allocation mechanisms.
* **Monitoring:** Be aware that all activities on RCC systems are subject to monitoring.

Failure to follow these principles may result in account termination.

RCC resources are dedicated to supporting legitimate research activities at the University of Chicago, and users must align with their account's stated purpose.

## User Accounts and Passwords

Account credentials are personal and should not be shared. If compromised, report immediately to RCC support staff. Sharing account or password information is strictly prohibited.

## Data Management

RCC maintains an open research network but assumes no responsibility for data stored on the general-purpose HPC systems it operates. In these collaborative environments, researchers are responsible for overseeing the protection and sharing of their own data. Access to user data by RCC system administrators is limited to what is necessary for user support, technical troubleshooting, or maintaining system security, in accordance with UChicago Information Technology Policies.

## Restricted Research Data

General-purpose RCC systems should not be used to store, process, transmit, or analyze restricted research data. Please contact us regarding your project as we offer a separate service, Secure Data Enclave, with resources dedicated to research on restricted data.

## Data Integrity and Retention

The RCC prioritizes robust filesystems and archival storage with performance and reliability. Backup services are limited and available only for directories with snapshots enabled. Users with specific data retention needs should notify RCC support staff for appropriate actions. 

Please adhere to these guidelines to ensure a positive and secure RCC experience.
